# Commit Style

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `type(scope): description`
Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`

# Commit Workflow

- After each completed, verified modification batch, create a git commit by default without waiting for an extra user reminder.
- Use small, reversible commits so problematic changes can be reverted cleanly.
- Only hold off on committing when the user explicitly asks not to commit yet, or when the work is still in a broken/unverified intermediate state.
- Do not push unless the user asks for a push.

# Releases

Version is derived automatically from git tags via `hatch-vcs` — there is no version string to edit in code.

**Semver rules:**
- `PATCH` (x.x.N) — bug fixes, internal cleanup, no behaviour change
- `MINOR` (x.N.0) — new feature or behaviour, backwards compatible
- `MAJOR` (N.0.0) — breaking change: CLI flags removed/renamed, output format changed, etc.

**When to tag:** when the accumulated commits since the last tag are ready for users — not every commit, not every PR. A meaningful feature or important fix is a good trigger.

**How to release:**
```sh
git tag v2.1.0
git push origin v2.1.0
```

That's it — no file edits needed. The version is read from the tag at build/install time.
